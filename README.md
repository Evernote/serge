**Serge** _(String Extraction and Resource Generation Engine)_ helps you
set up a seamless continuous localization process for your software
in a fully automated and scalable fashion. It allows developers to
concentrate on maintaining resource files in just one language (e.g. English),
and will take care of keeping all localized resources in sync and translated.
